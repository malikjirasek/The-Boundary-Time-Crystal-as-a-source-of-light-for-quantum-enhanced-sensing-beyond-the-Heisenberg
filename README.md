# The Boundary Time Crystal as a source of light for quantum enhanced sensing
In a Boundary Time Crystal (BTC), an ensemble of two level emitters can display oscillatory
behavior in its observables, due to coherent driving and collective dissipation. In the emerging time
crystal regime, the light emitted by a BTC displays persistent temporal correlations. In this paper,
we demonstrate how this light can be harnessed as a probing source for an optical phase shift φ
imprinted on the emission field by an onkown sample. We determine the fundamental bound of
sensitivity in the limit of long measurement times T and find scaling proportional to √T N 4 in the
time crystal regime, i.e. the bound obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time and
surpasses Heisenberg scaling in the system size. We further present a measurement protocol, for
which the estimation error exceeds Heisenberg scaling in system size by cascading the BTC’s output
into an auxiliary BTC, thereby leveraging the systems open nature

    ```sh
    pip install jupyter

3. **Run the scripts to generate data:**
- Navigate to the desired directory and run scripts
    ```sh
    path-to-repo/.venv/bin/python path-to-repo/Fig-xx/script.py

4. **Run the notebooks for plotting:**
- Navigate to the desired directory and start Jupyter
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
